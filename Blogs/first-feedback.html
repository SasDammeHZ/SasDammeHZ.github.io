          <h2>First Feedback</h2>
          <h3>The feedback:</h3>
          <p>Hi Sas. Welcome to the HZ HBO-ICT course and thank you for completing the Who-am-I questionnaire. I have
            read
            your answers and it struck me that your answers remain quite general when it comes to your future
            (profession). It is not necessary, but it can work against you. For example, if learning to program proves
            difficult or you have to do something that you are not interested in. Perhaps it is a good idea to orient
            yourself on your future profession. What does an “ICT-er” do? What types of functions are there? You can
            investigate this by, for example, talking to people who work in IT or job advertisements. But personally, I
            always find that talking to different people is the best way
            If you see a future in ICT, then I don't think you have to worry about jobs. There is still a shortage of
            trained professionals in that field, and it seems that this will continue for a while.

            I hope this answers your questions. But feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.

            Greetings,

            Daan de Waard
          </p>
          <h3>My thoughts:</h3>
          <p>I think the feedback is helpful and Daan made me encouraged to do more research about the field
            of ICT.</p>
