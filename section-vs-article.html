<p>The section or article element that is the question. To be completely honest I am not experienced enough to
  give my own opinion on it, so I read articles about what people thought was the right choice.
  I can fully agree with both sides, because my foundation of HTML is non-existent so I trust the opinions of
  'professionals' faster than my own on this subject. Perhaps after I have gathered more HTML experience I can
  truly say what I think is the right choice, but for now I am going to agree with this: "In summary, use section
  for thematic grouping of content, and article for independent pieces of content."
