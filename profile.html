        <h1>Basic info about me</h1>
        <p> 
          Hello! My Name is Sas. I am 22 years old and was born and raised in the Netherlands. 
          My previous study was Philosophy in Rotterdam. I currently have a part time job as a production worker.

        <h2>Personality traids related to ICT</h2>
        <P>If I had to point out something positive about myself I think I can work in an organized manner, knowing when things need to be finished and where to find them. A pitfall of myself is that I can think negatively about myself, meaning I assume the worst about a situation if it involves myself. 
          Looking at ICT as a study I hope to grow my connections, my only fear I have for the upcoming period is that I am going to fall behind because this is my first real experience with coding and what not. But for now it seems like fun and not that hard to keep up! 
        </P>
