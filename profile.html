      <h1>Basic info about me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My Name is Sas. I am 22 years old and was born and raised in the Netherlands.
        My previous study was Philosophy in Rotterdam. I currently have a part time job as a production worker.
      </p>

      <h2>Personality traids related to ICT</h2>
      <P>If I had to point out something positive about myself I think I can work in an organized manner, knowing when
        things need to be finished and where to find them. A pitfall of myself is that I can think negatively about
        myself, meaning I assume the worst about a situation if it involves myself.
        Looking at ICT as a study I hope to grow my connections, my only fear I have for the upcoming period is that I
        am going to fall behind because this is my first real experience with coding and what not. But for now it seems
        like fun and not that hard to keep up!
      </P>
