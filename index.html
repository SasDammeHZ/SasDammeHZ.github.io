          <h1>Why I am interested in the ICT programme</h1>
          <p>First of all I want to say I do not have any background in coding or what not, and to be honest (for now) I
            don't even know a lot about computers and how they really work. But When I looked at the ICT programme I saw
            it was not required to have experience in the field, the programme is especially built to give you
            information about all sorts of basics in the ICT world. So this already made me excited and interested. It
            meant I could learn a lot of different skills and see which one I like to develop further in the future.
            Because of this I was not discouraged to join. I am also a person who likes to spend a lot of time on my
            computer, so doing a study which requires you to do a lot of things behind a monitor sounds like a good fit
            for me. The programme also offers a hand-on approach to ICT, we get the chance to do an internship and see
            what it's really like. I like the sound of that, because of this I can actually develop my skills through
            projects, and not just theory. From the assignments I had done on this programme, I liked what I did,
            perhaps a bit challenging but for now I am not discouraged by it because I feel satisfaction from what I am
            doing. Lastly the ICT programme offers a lot of job opportunities which is probably one of the biggest
            reasons why I joined the programme. I am someone who is not that confident about their future and the ICT
            programme gives a lot of security on this aspect. There are a lot of companies in need of people who are
            working in the ICT world. For example here is an article about the ICT shortages:
            <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/nl/blog/ict-shortages-netherlands/#:~:text=ICT%20shortages%20%E2%80%93%20a%20global%20issue,be%20as%20high%20as%201%2C000%2C000."

            <h3>Why I think the ICT Programme is suited for me</h3>
            <p>I think the ICT programme is suited for me because I am keen to learn and interested in developing new
              skills. The programme structure aligns with my own goals; we are going to learn a lot of different skills
              and meet a lot of different people. I think I can adapt to people's needs in a project, at least to a
              certain extent, and that sounds like something that can be handy in the ICT world. And especially the ICT
              programme from HZ suits me because it is close to home, this way I don't get discouraged when traveling to
              school. This was a problem at my last study in Rotterdam, sometimes I had only 45 minutes of school, but
              for me to attend that class I had to travel for about 2 hours there and back, which greatly impacted my
              motivation. Lastly I think the ICT Programme is suited for me because it gives a lot of structure to my
              daily life, and that is something I want. I think I can benefit greatly from the structure the ICT
              programme provides.
